    Who is an ideal candidate for an eye donation?

  <p>  Referring to reception of the tissue, eye tissue is used several different ways, most commonly for corneal transplantation. Patients who need a corneal transplant are those who have a disease, scar, or active infection involving the cornea. The cornea is the clear part of the eye much like a watch crystal.

      Must an eye donor be dead

    <p>  For the most part, corneal donation comes from people who are dead. In very rare circumstances, a donor may be living. For example a patient who has an ocular tumor in the back of the eye may be able to donate the eye at the time the eye is removed. If an eye is blind and it is removed, but is healthy in the front, that cornea might also be used. There are no instances of donation between people who are living in other circumstances. Another special circumstance where a person may donate a cornea to themselves is where one eye can still see and one can't. That is very rare. </div>

      Can artificial tissue be used instead of a donor cornea?
     
      <svg class="control-icon control-icon-expand" width="24" height="24" role="presentation"><use xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="#expand-more" /></svg>

    </summary>
    <p>There are types of surgery called keratoprostheses, which use artificial corneas. These are very difficult to use and are still being investigated. Probably no more than 400 or 500 of these procedures are done each year worldwide. It's used where it's impossible to get the donor cornea to take. For example, some patients with severe scarring of the eye socket, where the lids don't operate normally, might benefit from a keratoprosthesis. There are newer types of prostheses being developed to substitute for the cornea, but nothing is as useful as a human-donated cornea.  </div>

              Would someone with diabetic retinopathy benefit from a corneal transplant?

            <p>Diabetic retinopathy affects the retina, not the cornea directly, so transplant would not help unless there is also a problem with the cornea. </div>

                  How long can the eye be recovered after donation?

                </summary>
                <p> It's always the sooner the better. Eye banks are allowed to set their own time frame but typically if the donor has been kept cool, the tissue may be recovered for up to 8-12 hours and then placed in special solution before 24 hours. This would allow the tissue to be used for up to seven days.  </div>
